I chose the Prosper loan data set. From my explorations I found that the loan amount did not show strong correlation to any of the other fields to determine the likelihood of defaulting or being late on a loan. I then had to explore a few more things like the borrower's history with Prosper and the length of the loan. The loan length did show some signifigance but overall the most obvious factor to have an effect on the loans listed in this set was borrower APR. This is why I chose to display it most in the explanatory slide set. I detailed more intensely in my notebook file in the step by step process. 

What can be learned from this data set? There are likely several questions you could pose but I am going to focus on what I would assume is the number one revenue performance indicator, paying a loan on time.

Unfortunately, the majority of the data points are in the successful category, per my criteria, which is 'Current' or 'Completed' which signifies a loan that is being paid on time. The rest are scenarios where a non-ideal status is present such as a payment being delayed or the loan counted off completely. Approximately 75% of the data falls into the 'successful' category.

The loan status and borrower APR show the most clear effect on loan completion based upon the fields I kept. It was clear that the majority of the loans that were past due, defaulted, or charged off had a higher annual percentage rate. This could be due to the fact that it is more difficult to pay something off when interest is accrued at a higher rate. But is this a function of their history of not paying off loans or not being a customer for Prosper in the past? Based upon this data we can say there is no indication of that. The quesion should now be asked, would Prosper be more profitable if they offered lower APRs? That is difficult to know from this data only but there is certainly cause for exploration of that option. After all, if it results in more profit then all parties would be happy.

Completed or Current loans have a slight left skew towards lower annual percentage rates while the opposite is true for the other 'unsuccessful' categories when looking at the cumulative distribution functions derived from the cleaned data set. Especially when it comes to the 'Past Due' category. This category could probably use more data points to paint a clearer picture of the impact. However, there are clear trends that APR could have a significant effect on whether or not loans are repayed as intended. I would suggest Prosper explore these trends with more data and other factors to increase their overall profit margins.

The only outside resources I used were the documentation texts and examples listed there linked in the lessons.
